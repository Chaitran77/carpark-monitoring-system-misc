# College-carpark-monitoring-system
This system aims to monitor the entry and exit of people through the college car park to allow the college to easily know when different students and teachers enter and leave college, as well as how they got to college (by car or not) which gives an indication of how green the college is (which could go on the records of students/teachers). This will also allow the college to know what students are not wearing lanyards when they enter, which can be followed up by the ‘grounds team/staff’. This will mean that they do not have to stand at the gate harassing students to show their lanyards. Also, recognition of packages. This would also mean that when the grounds team are on their breaks, if a person with and obscured /unidentifiable face and no lanyard and/or a package is detected entering the college, a high priority alert is added to the database for immediate viewing by the grounds team/receptionist. Interface to validate alarms – record locking so that alarm cannot be validated at the same time by more than one staff member. Viewing client has images linked to each alarm.
